## **Role Description**

You've learned the foundations of the Swift language and what it takes to build a functional and user friendly iOS application during this unit.

## **The `Core iOS` Unit explored the following topics:**

- Swift language features: mutability; the type system; conditional logic and looping; optionals; object-oriented design principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and composition
- The foundations of the Model-View-Controller design pattern for structuring code
- Protocol oriented programming and delegation
- User interface: app navigation with nav and tab bar controllers; Auto Layout; using various built-in controls to compose a coherent user experience
- Basic persistence of application state and model data using `Codable` and `UserDefaults`
- Displaying collections of data with table views and collection views

For your project, you will demonstrate proficiency by working with a group of students cross-section to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) over the course of the sprint.

## **Your primary role is as a iOS Developer:**

- [ ]  You will design and build the user interface and overall user experience of the iOS application (if a UX student is present, you'll work with them to determine the design).
- [ ]  Your iOS app should conform to the design practices established in class as well as the guidelines Apple provides in their [HIG (Human Interface Guidelines) document](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/).
- [ ]  The UI will be dependent on the data collected from the user as well as the data retrieved from any web APIs used for your app. Your further-along iOS partner will be responsible for this networking code, but you should help where you can to define the needs for the models and how those models will be represented in your UI.
- [ ]  The source code needs to be clean, properly formatted, and well documented. You'll work with your further-along iOS partner to ensure the app's code follows the best practices and industry standards for organization, formatting, and style.
